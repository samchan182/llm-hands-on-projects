# I downloaded some Denver City Council meeting minutes and selected a portion of the meeting for us to transcribe. You can download it here:

#
# If you'd rather work with the original data, the HuggingFace dataset is here https://huggingface.co/datasets/huuuyeah/meetingbank 
# 
# and the audio can be downloaded here https://huggingface.co/datasets/huuuyeah/MeetingBank_Audio/tree/main 
#
# The goal of this product is to use the Audio to generate meeting minutes, including actions.
#
# For this project, you can either use the Denver meeting minutes, or you can record something of your own!
